## About Me

![](/images/photo.jpg "senbong's photo"){.img-thumbnail #about-photo}

Hi! My name is Gee Sen Bong. I am a data scientist and currently living in Singapore.

I have received the Bachelor of Engineering degree (Hons.) in Electrical and Computer Engineering and Ph.D degree from [National University of Singapore](http://www.nus.edu.sg/) in 2011 and 2016, respectively. My thesis topic is about application of evolutionary algorithm to solve multi-objective optimization problem.

Apart from the academic research, I am passionate in machine learning and data science technology. To express my interest in applying these techniques, I actively participate in [Kaggle competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/).


## Skills

* **Black Box Optimization:** This is my Ph.D research area. I have a deep experience with evolutionary algorithm, genetic algorithm, differential Evolution, and multi-objective optimization in static and dynamic environment. I have applied these class of algorithms to solve numerical optimization (finding optimal weights classifiers) and combinatorial optimizatio problems (vehicle routing problem, delivery batching optimization).

* **Machine Learning:** This is an area where I have found my passion in. I have experiences in solving different types of machine learning problems, including logistic regression, image classification, time series problem, pairing problem and text mining.

* **Statistics:** My research experiences have taught me fundamental concepts of statistics. In many occasions, I have designed an experiment to study the effectiveness of a new algorithm.

* **Database:** As a data scientist, I have also become fluent with database querying languages. In many occasions, I have used SQL to perform some basic data wranging or feature engineering for data modeling or visualization purposes.

* **Data Visualization:** To visualize the relationship between different features, I use Tableau/matplotlib/ggplot to accomplish the task.

* **Programming Languages:** I have used C++ and Python for most of the data processing and research projects. I also have some experiences in R, Haskell, MATLAB, HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP.

* **Other Skills:** Object-oriented Programming, Imperative Programming, Functional Programming, Version Control System, Bash Script, Vim, LaTeX...
